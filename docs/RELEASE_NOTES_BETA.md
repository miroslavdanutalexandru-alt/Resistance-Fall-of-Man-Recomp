# Resistance: Fall of Man PC port: community beta release notes

**Version:** 0.2.3-beta (GitHub pre-release). **Release date:** _to be filled in on release_.

A native PC port of *Resistance: Fall of Man* (PS3) built by static recompilation: the game's PowerPC and SPU code is translated to C/C++ and compiled for Windows. Nothing is emulated. It renders through the port's own **Direct3D 12** renderer.

> **No game files and no prebuilt game are included.** This release is the source code plus Setup. You need your own legally dumped copy of the game (see *Install*); Setup builds the game on your PC from that copy.

This is a **beta**. The campaign has been played up to Cheddar Gorge. Later levels haven't been tested. Please report what you find (see *Reporting problems*).

## 0.2.3-beta (last hotfix)

This is the last hotfix. The next updates focus on performance and stability, based on your reports and playthroughs.

- **Setup works without winget.** If winget is missing or fails on your PC, Setup downloads the official installers of the build tools (Visual Studio Build Tools, CMake, Ninja, LLVM, Python, Git) directly, checks them (SHA-256 or Microsoft's signature) and installs them.
- **RecompLauncher support.** The port can be installed, set up and played from [RecompLauncher](https://recomplauncher.com): it checks your copy, builds the game, shows the main video settings on the game's page and starts the game. Your own Launcher.exe and Setup.exe work as before.
- The release zip is now named `...-Windows-x64.zip`.
## 0.2.2-beta (setup hotfix)

- **Fixed: the build could fail right away with a Ninja/CMake error** ("build.ninja still dirty", or CMake re-running in a loop) for players in time zones behind ours. Files from the download could be dated a few hours in the future. The installer and zips now carry correct times, and the build resets any future-dated files before it starts.

If your setup failed this way: install 0.2.2 (or wait a few hours) and run Setup again; it continues where it stopped.

## 0.2.1-beta (setup hotfix)

Setup fixes only; the game itself is unchanged from 0.2.0.

- **Progress bar during the build.** The bar no longer stops partway while the game compiles; it follows the build to the end, so Setup no longer looks stuck.
- **Setup shows that it is working:** a running clock for each step, the game copy in GB with the time left, the time left while the game compiles, and a "still working" note during steps that print nothing for several minutes.
- **The installer now opens the Setup window** (with the progress bar and your game already filled in) instead of a console window. Click **Install** there.
- **Much smaller build logs.** The compiler was set to report every possible warning, which made `logs\build.log` grow past 150 MB and slowed the build. It now reports normal warnings only.
- **Low-RAM PCs:** if the build runs out of memory, Setup again detects it and retries with fewer parallel jobs (this check could not read the build log in 0.2.0).

If 0.2.0 is already built and runs, you don't need this update.

## What's in this beta

### Launcher
- `Launcher.exe` holds all settings and key bindings. On first start it detects your hardware and picks a preset (Steam Deck included).
- Pages: Display, Graphics, Upscaling & Frame Gen, Performance, Controls, Audio, Interface & Notifications, Advanced, Achievements, Saves & tools and About (`Launcher.exe --page N` opens one, 0–10).
- The update check only opens the Releases page. Turn it off on the Advanced page or with `PORT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### Graphics
- **Anti-aliasing / upscaling:** Off, AMD FSR 3.1, NVIDIA DLSS / DLAA (GeForce RTX) or **Intel XeSS 2** (any DirectX 12 GPU with SM 6.4). Set it in the launcher or with `RSX_FSR` = 0 / 1 / 2 / 3.
  - If DLSS or XeSS can't start, the port uses FSR 3.1.
- **Render resolution** up to 4K (`RSX_RES_SCALE`). **Upscaling** renders the 3D scene at 67, 58, 50 or 33 % (`RSX_UPSCALE`); menus and HUD stay at full resolution.
  - A *1080p → DLSS 4K* preset is available for RTX 40 / 50 cards.
- **Frame rate targets** from 30 to 165, *Just under refresh* (`RFOM_FPS=vrr`, for G-Sync / FreeSync), *Original* pacing, or unlimited (`RFOM_FPS`).
  - Game speed is correct at every frame rate.
  - Frame-timed scripted sequences step at 30 fps automatically.
- **VRR / tearing control:** *Tearing: Allowed* presents immediately with VSync off, so G-Sync / FreeSync follows the frame rate. *Never* drops late frames instead of tearing (`RFOM_PRESENT=tearing|notear`).
- **NVIDIA Reflex** Low Latency through NVAPI (`RFOM_REFLEX`, off by default).
- **Ultrawide (Hor+)**, a field-of-view slider, and a performance overlay (F3).
- **Shader precompile:** with *Compile shaders before playing* (default on, `RSX_PSO_PRECOMPILE`), pipelines are built before the first frame, with a **Compiling shaders N / M** progress panel. Before Play, the launcher also runs the offline shader scan (shaderscan) with its own progress panel. Shader caches are built on your PC, never shipped. They are backed up to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ResistancePort\shadercache`.
- **Frame Generation** (experimental, off by default; Upscaling & Frame Gen page, `RFOM_DLSS_FG`, `RFOM_FG_BACKEND=auto|dlss|fsr3`): NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation 2x on an RTX 40, up to 4x on an RTX 50; other GPUs get AMD FSR 3 2x. The HUD is kept out of the generated frames.

### Controls
- **Mouse and keyboard:** raw mouse look (it doesn't emulate the stick), rebindable keys, and separate melee and interact keys.
- **Controllers through SDL3** (the default; `PAD_BACKEND=xinput` is still available): Xbox, PlayStation and others, swappable at any time.
- **Button prompts follow your device:** your keyboard keys, or Xbox buttons that match the real mapping. *Controller button prompts* (`RFOM_PAD_GLYPHS`) forces Xbox or PlayStation.

### PC features
- **PC menu:** F10, or hold Esc / Start. It has Resume, PC Options and **Quit to Desktop** with confirmation.
- **PC wording:** console references in the game's text use PC terms (`RFOM_PC_TEXT=0` turns this off).
- **Screenshots** (F12), a **mods folder**, fan-made **achievements** (launcher Achievements page, read from your save; the game itself has no trophies), and saves in *Saved Games*.
- **Notifications in the game image:** the F3 overlay and toasts are drawn into the game's own frame, so they also show in exclusive fullscreen (`RFOM_OSD=window` uses separate windows). The movie-skip hint can be turned off (*Show cutscene skip hint*, `PORT_SKIP_HINT=0`).
- A black cover window hides the switch between programs during level loads (`RFoMSwitch.exe`).
- **Crash and hang reports** are written automatically, and the game process can restart after a freeze.

### Audio
- **Time stretching** (SoundTouch, `PORT_AUDIO_STRETCH=1`, default on): frame drops make the audio slightly slower instead of crackling.

## What you download

- **`ResistancePort-Setup-0.2.0-beta.exe`** from the GitHub release: an installer with the port's source, scripts and `Launcher.exe`. It installs the files and starts Setup.
- or the **source code** (the release's source archive or `git clone` at the tag), then `Setup.bat`.

Either way, the game itself is built on your PC; no built game program is published. Setup downloads the build tools, FFmpeg (an LGPL build), shaderscan, AMD's FSR 3 frame generation DLL and, if you accept their licences, the NVIDIA DLSS, Streamline (DLSS Frame Generation) and Intel XeSS SDKs.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit. Steam Deck / Proton works; see the README.
- A CPU with **AVX2** (Intel 4th generation or newer, or any AMD Ryzen).
- A **DirectX 12** GPU. It has been tested on AMD RX 6700 XT and NVIDIA RTX 5070. DLSS needs a GeForce RTX card.
- The Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 x64 runtime, version 14.40 or newer.
- Your own copy of **Resistance: Fall of Man, US disc (BCUS98107), version 1.00**. Other regions and patched versions are not supported yet.
- About **25 GB** of free disk space: about 16.5 GB for the game files plus the build.
- For setup: an internet connection and the free build tools. Setup installs the tools itself.

## Install

1. **Dump your own game.** Use a decrypted ISO, or a game folder containing `PS3_GAME` (the same kind of folder RPCS3 uses), from your own disc.
2. **Install the port.** Either:
   - run `ResistancePort-Setup-<version>.exe`, which installs to `C:\Games\ResistancePort` by default and asks for your game; or
   - download the source code (the release's source archive, or `git clone` at the release tag) into a folder without spaces and double-click `Setup.bat`.
3. **Setup** finds or asks for your game (`Setup.bat -Game "<ISO or folder>"` skips the question). It then:
   - checks the copy and copies it to `gamefiles\PS3_GAME`;
   - decrypts the game's two program files to `game\`, using the public application keys from RPCS3's source;
   - downloads FFmpeg, shaderscan and the optional SDKs (DLSS, Streamline, XeSS; each after you accept its licence);
   - generates and builds the game-specific code. This takes 20–60 minutes the first time.
4. **Play** with `Launcher.exe`.

**How the port finds your game:**
- `run.bat`, which the launcher starts, runs `build\ResistanceFoM.exe` with `game\EBOOT.elf` and points the game's virtual disc at `gamefiles` (`PS3_VFS_ROOT`).
- Settings and controls are also kept in `%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\Resistance Fall of Man\config`. An empty `portable.txt` turns that off.

**First launch:** before the game starts, the launcher prepares the shader cache from your game files (a progress panel; about 1–2 minutes the first time; **Skip for now** or Esc skips it). The game then compiles its known shaders behind a **Compiling shaders N / M** panel and shows its one-time "initial setup" screens. Later starts are fast.

## Known issues

- **Performance can dip in heavy areas.** The cost comes from the game's chained SPU jobs; a faster CPU helps the most.
- **Frame Generation is experimental and barely tested** (DLSS on RTX 40/50, FSR 3 elsewhere; off by default). Expect ghosting and HUD or menu artifacts; reports are welcome.
- **Audio crackle** can happen when the frame rate drops in intensive spots, for example coming out of the crater at the start of York.
- **Falling through the floor** has been seen a few times. A safeguard tries to put you back in place.
- **Shadows can flicker** occasionally.
- **FSR can ghost** on some things, such as the sky, at rare moments. DLSS doesn't show this.
- **Out-of-bounds water** (off the dock in Grimsby, under the bridge in Manchester) shows some stray triangles.
- **The Rollers level** hasn't been reached on this port yet. On RPCS3 it needed OpenGL.
- **Ultrawide HUD:** the HUD is stretched with the view, not kept in a centred 16:9 area.
- **Two programs:** the main menu and the levels are separate programs on the disc, so the game process restarts between them; a black cover window hides the switch.
- Everything else, including levels after Cheddar Gorge: **TBD after testing**.
- What's planned next: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
